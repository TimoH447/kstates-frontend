    <h1>About K.States</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>K.States</strong> is a web application for visualizing state lattices of knots.
      You can input a knot diagram in <em>PD notation</em> and select a fixed segment to generate the
      associated Kauffman state lattice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The site returns a visualization of the lattice as well as relevant metadata, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Number of Kauffman states</li>
      <li>Number of lattice layers</li>
      <li>Minimum and maximum marker positions</li>
      <li>Sequence of transpositions from min to max state</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This tool is designed for knot theorists, researchers, and enthusiasts who work with
      diagrammatic invariants or are exploring the combinatorics of state models.
